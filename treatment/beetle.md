### About this pest
Beetles are everywhere. Beetles differ from all other winged insects by having the first pair of wings hardened and thickened. These hard forewings serve as a protective shield for the fragile flying wings, which are folded underneath. Adult flea beetles cause the most damage by feeding on the leaves and stems. They create shallow pits and small rounded, irregular holes (usually less than 1/8th inch) in the leaves. This type of damage is unique to flea beetles.
